We decided to use the same style as DankBank for our main menu, using a minimalistic
main screen with a floating action button that takes the user to the transaction
page. We changed the color scheme of this page to better suit use by children,
replacing the dark grey/purple theme with a brighter orange/pink theme.

We chose not to add a confirmation dialog because we deemed it unnecessary for an
application as basic as this, as the user can simply undo the transaction themselves
by making the opposite transaction directly after.

The thing that caused us the most confusion was trying to get the data to remain
after completely closing the app. Eventually we realized this is more difficult
than we thought and not necessary according to the specifications of this
assignment.
